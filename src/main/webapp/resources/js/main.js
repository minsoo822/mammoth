//	Implementation Summary
//
//	1. Enforce API surface and semantic compatibility with 1.9.x branch
//	2. Improve the module's maintainability by reducing the storage
//		paths to a single mechanism.
//	3. Use the same single mechanism to support "private" and "user" data.
//	4. _Never_ expose "private" data to user code (TODO: Drop _data, _removeData)
//	5. Avoid exposing implementation details on user objects (eg. expando properties)
//	6. Provide a clear path for implementation upgrade to WeakMap in 2014

/**
 * Sets the type of metadata to use. Metadata is encoded in JSON, and each property
 * in the JSON will become a property of the element itself.
 *
 * There are three supported types of metadata storage:
 *
 *   attr:  Inside an attribute. The name parameter indicates *which* attribute.
 *
 *   class: Inside the class attribute, wrapped in curly braces: { }
 *
 *   elem:  Inside a child element (e.g. a script tag). The
 *          name parameter indicates *which* element.
 *
 * The metadata for an element is loaded the first time the element is accessed via jQuery.
 *
 * As a result, you can define the metadata type, use $(expr) to load the metadata into the elements
 * matched by expr, then redefine the metadata type and run another $(expr) for other elements.
 *
 * @name $.metadata.setType
 *
 * @example <p id="one" class="some_class {item_id: 1, item_label: 'Label'}">This is a p</p>
 * @before $.metadata.setType("class")
 * @after $("#one").metadata().item_id == 1; $("#one").metadata().item_label == "Label"
 * @desc Reads metadata from the class attribute
 *
 * @example <p id="one" class="some_class" data="{item_id: 1, item_label: 'Label'}">This is a p</p>
 * @before $.metadata.setType("attr", "data")
 * @after $("#one").metadata().item_id == 1; $("#one").metadata().item_label == "Label"
 * @desc Reads metadata from a "data" attribute
 *
 * @example <p id="one" class="some_class"><script>{item_id: 1, item_label: 'Label'}</script>This is a p</p>
 * @before $.metadata.setType("elem", "script")
 * @after $("#one").metadata().item_id == 1; $("#one").metadata().item_label == "Label"
 * @desc Reads metadata from a nested script element
 *
 * @param String type The encoding type
 * @param String name The name of the attribute to be used to get metadata (optional)
 * @cat Plugins/Metadata
 * @descr Sets the type of encoding to be used when loading metadata for the first time
 * @type undefined
